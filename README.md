Assignment 1 - Using Admissible &amp; Consistent Heuristics for Pacman AI

For my AI class, this assignment explored the variety of search algorithms and their optimizations.

Search Algorithms Included are:
- BFS
- DFS
- UCS
- A*
- Local Search

The Heuristics chosen for A* was the Manhattan distance between the origin and target.
